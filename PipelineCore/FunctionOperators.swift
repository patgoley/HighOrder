/*
 The following overload allows the chaining of any two
 synchronous functions, as long as they meet certain type
 constraints.
 
 A synchronous function has one of the following signatures:
 
 producer: () -> T
 
 transformer: T -> U
 
 consumer: T -> Void
 
 Even though this overload appears to be only for chaining two
 transformers, it also applies where T or U are () meaning that 
 neither of the functions are required to take input or produce 
 a return value.
