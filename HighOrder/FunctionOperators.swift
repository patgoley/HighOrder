/*
 The following overload allows the chaining of any two
 synchronous functions, as long as they meet certain type
 constraints.
 
 This overload is also usable where any of
 T, U, or V are (), meaning that neither of the functions
 are required to take input or produce a return value.
 
 This allows any one or zero arity function to be chained
 to any other one or zero arity function. If `lhs`
 produces a return value and the `rhs` accepts an
 argument, the result of `lhs` is passed to `rhs`.
